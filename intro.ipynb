        "\n",
        "Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "**It is used for:**\n",
        "*   **web development (server-side),**\n",
        "*   **software development,**\n",
        "*   **mathematics,**\n",
        "*   **system scripting.**\n",

        "# **What can Python do?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Why Python?\n",
        "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
        "* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
        "Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
        "* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
        "* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
        "# Good to know\n",
        "* The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. \n",
        "* However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.\n",
        "* In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. * It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.\n",
        "# Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
        "* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
        "* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
        "* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose."
